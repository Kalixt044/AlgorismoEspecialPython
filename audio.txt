In my daily life, I have several responsibilities that I must fulfill to keep everything in order. First, 
I have to clean the house every day to ensure that my home is clean and welcoming. After each meal, 
I must wash the dishes to prevent them from piling up and to keep my kitchen in good condition.
Additionally,
I vacuum the living room regularly to keep the space free of dust and dirt.
In my work environment, I have to finish my work before the deadline to meet my obligations and avoid delays.
I must attend meetings to stay updated on new developments and collaborate with my team. 
Regarding my studies, I have to study for my exams to be prepared and have good results. I must read the 
assigned chapters before class to actively participate in discussions.
I review my notes every week to reinforce my learning and not forget what I have studied.
Finally, to keep up with my academic duties, I have to submit my homework on time to meet the established 
deadlines. I must participate in class discussions to enrich my learning and share my ideas. 
I stay organized to manage my assignments effectively and avoid stress.

These activities are essential to maintain a balance between my household, work, and academic responsibilities.
