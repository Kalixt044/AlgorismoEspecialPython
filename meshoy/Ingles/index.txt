Hello!
My Academic and Professional Journey"
(Duration: ~5 minutes | Clear pronunciation, moderate pace)

1. Introduction 

(Confident tone, natural pauses)
*"Hello, my name is Juan David Rodríguez. My ID number is 123456789, and I am a student at SENA in the program with Ficha 99. Today, I will share my academic
 journey, career plans, and how I solve problems using English 
(Short pause, background music fades in softly.)

2. Academic & Work Background (30%)
(Structured, uses past tense and conditionals)
"I chose SENA to become a software developer. Before this, I worked as a customer service assistant. That job helped me improve my communication 
skills and teamwork. Now, I focus on learning programming and English because if I master these skills, I will get better job opportunities."

(Transition: "Let me tell you about my goals...")


3. Goals & Plans (Conditionals: First & Second)
"In the future, I want to work for a tech company. If I study hard, I will achieve this dream. I also plan to study software Engineering at university.
If I save money, I will pay for my degree. But if I don’t learn English now, I wouldn’t have the same chances. That’s why I practice every day."

(Pause, tone shifts to problem-solving.)

4. Problem-Solving & Decisions (Zero & Second Conditional)
"When I face a problem, I stay calm and analyze solutions. For example, if I don’t understand a topic, I ask my instructors or classmates.
If I were a leader, I would listen to my team and support them. Flexibility is key—if a project changes, I adapt quickly."

(Transition: "In a job context...")

5. Soft Skills in Work (Modals & Opinions)
"At work, you must be punctual and responsible. If you arrive late, your boss will not be happy. I always try my best and meet deadlines. 
Leadership isn’t just giving orders—it’s about helping others. I believe teamwork and adaptability make a great professional."

6. Closing (Cohesion & Vocabulary)
"To sum up, success depends on good decisions, hard work, and adaptability. SENA is helping me build this path. Thank you for listening!"

What was the result of the experience?
The experience provided me with several valuable outcomes. I gained significant knowledge in legal text research and translation,
which improved my ability to communicate complex information through email correspondence. Additionally, I was able to expand my
professional network considerably. One of the most important results was learning about personal data legislation and understanding 
how to obtain this type of information across Latin America. Furthermore, I developed practical skills in database creation and 
learned how to apply these tools effectively within the company's business model. These results have given me a stronger foundation
for my professional development.

How did your flexibility and adaptability help you to deal with the situation?
While the work itself offered flexibility, I had to adapt to significant challenges, particularly when starting my training in 
technological topics with emphasis on web scraping and development. This required considerable adaptability since these were 
completely new areas for me. My flexibility allowed me to dedicate most of my working time to mastering these skills, 
understanding that this investment would help me apply for better positions in the future. I had to adjust my learning approach 
and time management to balance both my current responsibilities and acquiring these new technical competencies.

Would you change anything in order to deal in a better way with it?
Looking back, I would definitely change my approach regarding additional work.
I attempted to maintain two jobs simultaneously to earn extra money, but this proved to be a poor decision.
Although I needed the additional income for daily expenses, the time investment required for second jobs demanded full-time 
commitment while offering lower pay than my remote position. This situation consistently made me feel out of place and overwhelmed.
I believe there are no guarantees for decent work that simultaneously allows for academic training. Therefore, the only thing I 
would change would be to focus on seeking better opportunities abroad, which is why I'm committed to improving my English skills as
a long-term strategy.
